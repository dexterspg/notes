Jackson allows json to pojo and pojo to json conversion (deserialization and serialization)

Path Variable reads to  get specific record
    the path variable should match with the argument variable

for exception handling
    need a class that stores the error response ex. StudentErrorResponse  that accepts status, message and timestamp
    need a custom exception class that handle exception and sends the error response when exception was thrown
    @ExceptionHandler is annotation used for handling REst exception

    for global exception for  a pojo created, we can create a custom class and annotate it with @ControllerAdvice while methods with @ExceptionHandler
        @ControllerAdvice is similar to interceptor/filter (real-time use of AOP)
